  > *Out of the night that covers me; dark as the pit from pole to pole;
  > I thank whatever God maybe; for my unconquerable soul:
  > In the fell night of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud;
  > Under the bludgeonings of chance; my head is bloody, but unbowed;*
  > **Beyond this place of Wrath and Tears; Looms but the Horror of the Shade;
  > And yet the Menace of the years finds and shall find me Unafraid.
  > It matters not how straight the gate; how charged with punishments the scroll;
  > I am the master of my fate;
  > I am the Captain of my Soul**.
